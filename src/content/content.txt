Introduction
Agriculture is the bedrock of economic sustainability.​
It is a key contributor to GDP, trade, and employment.​
The world population is expected to reach over 9 billion by 2050, which will require an increase in agricultural and food production by 70% to fit the need.​
Sustainable agricultural practices are necessary to ensure long-term food security, especially with growing population pressures and environmental concerns.​

Why Need AI?​
AI offers a strategic shift toward sustainable and smart agriculture, ensuring food security and economic growth.​
AI technology, leading to increased efficiency in agricultural field.​
AI provides predictive analytics for crop selection, sowing, and harvesting.​
AI optimizes use of resources like water, fertilizers, and pesticides.​
AI analyzes historical data to recommend climate-resilient crops suitable for specific regions.​

Challenges Faced by Farmers:​
Agricultural sector faces numerous challenges in order to maximize its yield.​
Labor Intensive nature​
Weed Management​
Plant Diseases​
Soil Productivity​
